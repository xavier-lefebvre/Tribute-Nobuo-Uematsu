            <p>Nobuo Uematsu (植松 伸夫, Uematsu Nobuo, born March 21, 1959) is a Japanese musician and composer, best known
                for
                his
                contributions to the Final Fantasy video game series by Square Enix.
                A self-taught musician, he began playing the piano at the age of twelve, with English singer-songwriter
                Elton
                John as one of his biggest influences. Uematsu joined Square in 1986,
                where he first met Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. The two later worked together on many
                titles at
                the
                company, most notably in the Final Fantasy series.
                After nearly two decades with Square, Uematsu left in 2004 to create his own production company, which
                included
                the Dog Ear Records music label.
                He has since composed music as a freelancer for other games, including ones developed by Square Enix and
                Sakaguchi's development studio, Mistwalker.

            <blockquote>"I believe that there are still people who believe that game music is something equal to just an
                effect incorporated into the game, something like a BGM.
                And therefore this is something that I would like to show that is not true." Nobuo Uematsu
